This directory contains scripts for the ConMan daemon to connect to
a console via an external process.

Be aware that any customizations made to these scripts will be lost
when a new version of the package is installed.  Instead, copy those
scripts needing local customizations to another directory (e.g.,
/etc/conman/exec) and modify the copies.  The "execpath" directive
in conman.conf can be used to give precedence to the local copies
over the default scripts.
